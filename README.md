# Newsies Fandom Survey Results

This repository presents data from the 2021 Newsies Fandom Survey/Census, a semi quantative study of members of the Newsies Fandom.

The survey was conducted between 25 May 2021 and 31 December 2021, and advertised through social media (Tumblr, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and word of mouth.) The survey was primarily shared through the author's social networks on thsi site, although efforts were made to reach people outside the author's circles through outreach to accounts associated with podcasts and blogs. 

Inclusion criteria for the survey included that the participant was 18 (or of age to consent to reserach in their juristiction) and willing and able to provide informed consent. Documentation of informed consent was waived, as this would have created an identifiable link to the participants. The survey data was collected using a google form and the collection was anonymous.

The questionaire covered 5 general areas; the questionaire and responses are tabulated in the data section.
